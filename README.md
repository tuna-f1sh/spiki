# spiki - spirals for KiCad

a simple application to generate a KiCad footprint (module) for spiral inductors on the PCB.

To run it you will need
- [PyQt](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt), used for the GUI
- [fasthenry](http://www.rle.mit.edu/cpg/research_codes.htm), used to compute the actual inductance
  Source code for an updated fasthenry version can be downloaded from [Whiteley Research Inc.](http://wrcad.com/freestuff.html), at http://wrcad.com/ftp/pub/fasthenry-3.0wr-110915.tar.gz  
  A Windows executable is also available there, at http://wrcad.com/ftp/pub/fasthenry-3.0wr-092815-setup.exe
- [NLopt](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt), to find the inductor dimensions (spacing only, currently) to obtain a defined inductance value

The `fasthenry` executable needs to be in the path (or in the same directory as `spiki.py`)

## How to use it

The GUI has just a single window, where all the relevant parameters are entered:

### External Deps

```
#fasthenry, used to compute the actual inductance
curl wrcad.com/ftp/pub/fasthenry-3.0wr-110915.tar.gz
tar -zxvf fasthenry-3.0wr-110915.tar.gz
cd fasthenry-3.0wr-110915.tar.gz && make && cp bin/fasthenry ./../../
#NLopt, to find the inductor dimensions
curl https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt/archive/v2.6.1.tar.gz
cmake . && make && make install
```

### Inductor parameters
- number of turns : also partial turns (e.g. 3.5) are accepted and sometimes useful to position the terminals at a convenient angle
- inner radius : distance of the spiral starting point from the center
- pitch : distance between the center line of two adjacent turns
- spacing : spacing between two adjacent turns.  
  Pitch and spacing above are of course related and changing one changes automatically the other
- trace width : width of the conductor trace. Changing this force a change in the spacing to keep the pitch constant
- number of layers : number of layer used for the spiral trace. At present only 1 and 2 are supported
- estimated inductance : inductance estimated by a closed-form formula.
  For 1-layer inductor the estimate is usually good, for 2-layers can be quite off

### PCB properties
- PCB thickness : needed for 2-layer inductors
- copper thickness : trace thickness, used to compute the inductor resistance and, indirectly, its merit factor Q
- min spacing

### Settings
- drawing tolerance : maximum deviation from the ideal spiral shape; the spirals are approximated with straight segments
- inductor style : at present only circular is supported

### Simulation
- frequency : used to compute the actual inductance and losses
- skin depth : for info, to compare with the trace width and thickness
- inductance : value obtained from the simulation
- resistance : value obtained from the simulation
- Q : the ratio between the inductive reactance and the resistance, at the simulation frequency

Pressing the *Run simulation* button starts the `fasthenry` program in the background. While the program is running, the message *Simulating...* is shown in the status bar at the bottom

- desired inductance : used for the optimization. The spacing will be adjusted to obtain this value of inductance, at the frequency specified above

Pressing the *optimize* button runs the `fasthenry` program in the background, changing the inductor traces spacing until the desired inductance value is obtained. Requires the [NLopt library](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt) with Python bindings to be installed.

Once a spiral inductor with the desired characteristics has been obtained, the corresponding KiCad footprint can be saved to a file by using the top menu (File -> Save module)

## Examples

Here are some pictures of spiral inductors generated with spiki

- 3.5 turn, two layers
